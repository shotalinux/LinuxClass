### 1-hello.sh
A basic script demonstrating how to print "Hello, World!" and possibly take a simple input or print a message to the user.

### 2-moreinput.sh
Explores user input further, likely prompting for and handling additional data from the user.

### 3-basicmathsample.sh
Shows how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Bash using shell syntax.

### 4-indented.sh
Demonstrates using indentation for readability and possibly structured output or code blocks in scripts.

### 5-diskusage.sh
Calculates and displays disk usage statistics, probably using the `du` or `df` commands.

### 6-loops.sh
Contains examples of loop constructs (for, while, until) and demonstrates their usage in shell scripting.

### 7-functions.sh
Introduces and showcases the use of functions to organize and reuse code in shell scripts.

### 8-fibonacci.sh
Generates Fibonacci numbers, demonstrating loops, variables, and arithmetic in shell scripting.

### 9-factor.sh
Calculates the factors of a given number, using loops and conditional logic.

### 10-triang.sh
Likely computes or prints triangular numbers, which are part of a mathematical sequence.

### 11-central-polygonal-numbers.sh
Calculates central polygonal numbers, another mathematical sequence, using shell scripting logic.

### 12-hexagonal-number.sh
Computes hexagonal numbers, demonstrating more advanced arithmetic and scripting techniques.

### 13-menu.sh
Creates a text-based menu interface, allowing users to select options and perform different actions.

### 14-case.sh
Demonstrates the use of the `case` statement in shell scripting for decision-making.

### salesdata.txt
A sample data file, possibly used by one or more scripts above for demonstrations or exercises.
